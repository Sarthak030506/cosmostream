# Video Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete video upload system has been implemented for CosmoStream, allowing approved creators to upload space and astronomy videos with full metadata management, real-time progress tracking, and automated processing.

---

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Layer
**File**: `database/migrations/006_video_upload_enhancements.sql`

Added new columns to the `videos` table:
- `file_size` (BIGINT) - Original file size in bytes
- `processing_progress` (INTEGER 0-100) - Processing completion percentage
- `error_message` (TEXT) - Error details for failed uploads
- `completed_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When processing finished
- New indexes for optimized creator dashboard queries

### 2. Backend - GraphQL Schema
**File**: `apps/api/src/graphql/schema.ts`

**New Types:**
- `VideoFeed` - Paginated video list with hasMore and totalCount
- `VideoFilterStatus` enum - Filter videos by ALL, UPLOADING, PROCESSING, READY, FAILED

**Enhanced Video Type** with new fields:
- fileSize, processingProgress, errorMessage, completedAt

**New Queries:**
- `myVideos(status, limit, offset): VideoFeed!` - Get creator's videos with filtering

**New Mutations:**
- `requestUploadUrl(title, description, tags, category, difficulty): UploadUrl!` - Get presigned S3 URL
- `requestThumbnailUploadUrl(videoId): UploadUrl!` - Get presigned URL for custom thumbnail
- `completeVideoUpload(videoId, fileSize): Video!` - Notify server when upload finishes
- `updateVideo(...)` - Enhanced to support category, difficulty, thumbnailUrl

### 3. Backend - Video Resolvers
**File**: `apps/api/src/graphql/resolvers/video.ts`

**Implemented Queries:**
- `myVideos` - Fetch creator's videos with status filtering and pagination
  - Supports filtering by ALL, READY, PROCESSING, UPLOADING, FAILED
  - Returns total count and hasMore flag for infinite scroll

**Implemented Mutations:**
- `requestUploadUrl` - Generates presigned S3 URL for direct video upload
  - Creates video record with status 'uploading'
  - Validates creator approval status
  - 1-hour URL expiry

- `requestThumbnailUploadUrl` - Generates presigned URL for thumbnail upload
  - Validates video ownership
  - Supports JPEG images
  - 30-minute URL expiry

- `completeVideoUpload` - Called after successful S3 upload
  - Updates file size
  - Changes status to 'processing'
  - Triggers video processing queue (TODO: integrate with media processor)

- `updateVideo` - Enhanced to support metadata updates
  - Title, description, tags, category, difficulty, custom thumbnail

**Field Resolvers:**
- Added field resolvers for all new snake_case database columns

## Technical Architecture

### Upload Flow:
```
User → Upload Page → Request Presigned URL (API)
                  ↓
              S3 Upload (Direct, Client-Side)
                  ↓
        Complete Upload (API) → Update DB Status
                  ↓
          Media Processor Queue (TODO)
                  ↓
          WebSocket Updates → Client
```

### Data Flow:
```
Client (React) ←→ Apollo Client ←→ GraphQL API ←→ PostgreSQL
       ↓
   Socket.io ←→ Realtime Server ←→ Redis Pub/Sub
```

### File Storage:
- **Raw Uploads**: `s3://uploads/USER_ID/VIDEO_ID/original.mp4`
- **Thumbnails**: `s3://thumbnails/USER_ID/VIDEO_ID/custom-thumbnail.jpg`
- **Processed**: `s3://videos/VIDEO_ID/` (HLS manifests)

---

## What Still Needs Integration

### 1. Media Processor Queue Integration
**File to modify**: `apps/api/src/graphql/resolvers/video.ts`

In the `completeVideoUpload` mutation, add video to processing queue:

```typescript
// After updating status to 'processing'
import { addVideoJob } from '../../../media-processor/src/queue';

await addVideoJob({
  videoId,
  s3Key: videoCheck.rows[0].s3_key,
  priority: 10
});
```

### 2. Enhanced Thumbnail Generation
**File to complete**: `apps/media-processor/src/processors/video.ts`

Implement the `generateThumbnail` function using ffmpeg:
- Extract frame at 10% timestamp
- Resize to 1280x720
- Upload to S3
- Update database with URL

### 3. Processing Progress Updates
**File to enhance**: `apps/media-processor/src/processors/video.ts`

Add progress callbacks during MediaConvert processing:
- Update database `processing_progress` column
- Broadcast updates via Redis pub/sub:
  ```typescript
  redis.publish(`video:${videoId}`, JSON.stringify({
    status: 'PROCESSING',
    progress: 25
  }));
  ```

### 4. Realtime Server Event Broadcasting
**File to enhance**: `apps/realtime/src/handlers/video.ts`

Add Redis subscriber to receive processing updates:
```typescript
redis.subscribe(`video:*`);
redis.on('message', (channel, message) => {
  const videoId = channel.split(':')[1];
  io.to(`video:${videoId}`).emit('video:processing_update', JSON.parse(message));
});
```

### 5. S3 Event Listener (Optional)
**File to create**: `apps/api/src/services/s3-events.ts`

Listen for S3 upload completion events via SNS/SQS:
- Automatically trigger `completeVideoUpload` when S3 upload detected
- Eliminates need for client-side API call

---

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Become an Approved Creator
```sql
-- In PostgreSQL
INSERT INTO creator_profiles (user_id, verified, approval_status)
VALUES ('your-user-id', true, 'approved');

-- Update user role
UPDATE users SET role = 'creator' WHERE id = 'your-user-id';

-- Update localStorage in browser
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
  id: 'your-user-id',
  name: 'Your Name',
  role: 'CREATOR'
}));
```

### 2. Test Upload Flow
1. Navigate to `/upload`
2. Fill in video details
3. Upload a small video file (e.g., 10MB test video)
4. Verify:
   - Upload progress shows
   - API receives completeVideoUpload call
   - Video appears in dashboard with "processing" status

### 3. Test Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/videos`
2. Verify:
   - Video appears in list
   - Status badge shows correctly
   - Can edit title/description
   - Can delete video

### 4. Test WebSocket Updates (when integrated)
1. Upload a video
2. Keep dashboard open
3. Verify status updates in real-time as processing occurs

## API Endpoints

### GraphQL Queries
```graphql
query GetMyVideos {
  myVideos(status: ALL, limit: 20, offset: 0) {
    items {
      id
      title
      status
      processingProgress
      fileSize
      createdAt
    }
    hasMore
    totalCount
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Mutations
```graphql
mutation RequestUpload {
  requestUploadUrl(
    title: "Test Video"
    description: "Description"
    category: "category-id"
    difficulty: "beginner"
    tags: ["astronomy", "cosmos"]
  ) {
    uploadUrl
    videoId
  }
}

mutation CompleteUpload {
  completeVideoUpload(
    videoId: "video-id"
    fileSize: 123456789
  ) {
    id
    status
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Direct S3 Upload**: Files upload directly to S3, not through API server
- **Chunked Upload Support**: XMLHttpRequest supports automatic chunking for large files
- **Resume Capability**: Can be enhanced by tracking upload chunks
- **CDN Delivery**: Processed videos served through CloudFront
- **Optimized Queries**: Database indexes on creator_id + status
- **Pagination**: All video lists support limit/offset pagination
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket reduces polling overhead

---

## Security

- ✅ Creator approval required for uploads
- ✅ Ownership validation on all mutations
- ✅ Presigned URL expiry (1 hour for videos, 30 min for thumbnails)
- ✅ File type validation on frontend
- ✅ File size limit enforced (10GB)
- ✅ JWT authentication for all API calls
- ✅ JWT authentication for WebSocket connections
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ⚠️ TODO: Malware scanning on uploaded files
- ⚠️ TODO: Content moderation queue

---

   - Draft videos (save without publishing)
   - Batch upload (multiple videos at once)
   - Video trimming/editing tools
   - Subtitle/caption upload
   - 4K video support
   - Live streaming

4. **Improve UX**
   - Upload resume after connection drop
   - Background upload (continue in new tab)
   - Thumbnail selection from video frames
   - Preview video before publishing
   - Analytics on upload page

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Upload success/failure metrics
