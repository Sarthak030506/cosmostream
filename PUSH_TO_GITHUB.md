## 🚀 Steps to Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

**Option A: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)**

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Name**: `cosmostream` or `CosmoStream`
   - **Description**: `🌌 A niche video streaming platform for space, astronomy, and astrophysics content`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these!)
3. **Click**: "Create repository"

**Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)**

```bash
gh repo create cosmostream --public --source=. --remote=origin --description="Space video streaming platform"
```

---

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see commands. Run these:

```bash
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\CosmoStream

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cosmostream.git

# Or if you prefer SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/cosmostream.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
```bash
# If your GitHub username is "sarthakgodse"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sarthakgodse/cosmostream.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 3: Authenticate (First Time Only)

When you push for the first time, Git will ask for authentication:

**Option 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Note: "CosmoStream Access"
3. Expiration: 90 days (or your preference)
4. Scopes: Check "repo" (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. When Git asks for password, paste the token

**Option 2: GitHub CLI**
```bash
gh auth login
```

**Option 3: SSH Keys** (if you have them configured)
- Use SSH URL instead of HTTPS

---

## 🎯 Complete Commands (Copy-Paste)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\CosmoStream

# Check current status
git status

# Add GitHub remote (REPLACE YOUR-USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cosmostream.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**This is correct!** These files are:
- Generated during `npm install` and `npm build`
- Contain secrets
- Are specific to your machine

---

## 🔍 Verify Upload

After pushing, verify on GitHub:

1. **Visit**: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cosmostream
2. **Check**:
   - ✅ Files are visible
   - ✅ README.md displays on homepage
   - ✅ Commit history shows your initial commit
   - ✅ File count: 95 files

## 🎨 Make Your README Look Professional

After pushing, GitHub will display your README.md. You can enhance it:

### Add Badges

Add these to the top of `README.md`:

```markdown

[![Node.js Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-%3E%3D20.0.0-brightgreen)](https://nodejs.org/)
[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5.3-blue)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

[Demo](https://your-demo-url.com) | [Documentation](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) | [Architecture](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
```

### Add Screenshot

1. Take screenshot of your homepage at http://localhost:3000
2. Save as `screenshot.png` in root directory
3. Add to README:
   ```markdown
   ## 🖼️ Screenshot

   ![CosmoStream Homepage](screenshot.png)
   ```
4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add screenshot.png README.md
   git commit -m "docs: add screenshot and badges to README"
   git push
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote origin already exists"
```bash
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cosmostream.git
```

### Error: "Authentication failed"
- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or use `gh auth login` if you have GitHub CLI

### Error: "Permission denied (publickey)"
- You're using SSH without SSH keys
- Use HTTPS URL instead: `https://github.com/...`

### Error: "Updates were rejected"
```bash
# Force push (ONLY on first push to empty repo)
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps After Push

### 1. Add Topics on GitHub

On your repository page:
1. Click "Add topics"
2. Add: `video-streaming`, `space`, `astronomy`, `nextjs`, `graphql`, `typescript`, `docker`, `microservices`

### 2. Add Description

Edit the "About" section:
```
🌌 A niche video streaming platform for space, astronomy, and astrophysics content
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to host documentation:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch
3. Branch: main → /docs

### 4. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

Settings → Branches → Add rule:
- Branch name pattern: `main`
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging

### 5. Create GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is already in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`!

To activate:
1. Push to main (it's already there!)
2. GitHub Actions will run automatically
3. View: Actions tab on GitHub
