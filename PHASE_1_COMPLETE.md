## 🧪 How to Test

### **1. Start the Development Server**
```bash
cd C:\Users\hp\Desktop\CosmoStream

# Make sure Docker is running with databases
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Start API server (Terminal 1)
cd apps/api
npm run dev

# Start Web server (Terminal 2)
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### **2. Test Login Flow**
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign In" in navigation
3. Use demo account: `viewer@cosmostream.com` / `password123`
4. You should see your name in the navigation bar
5. Click on your name to see dropdown menu
6. Click "Sign Out" to logout

### **3. Test Signup Flow**
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/signup`
2. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Your Name
   - Email: yourname@example.com
   - Password: password123
   - Confirm Password: password123
3. Check "I agree to Terms"
4. Click "Create Account"
5. You'll be logged in and redirected to homepage

### **4. Test Browse Page**
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/browse`
2. You should see 3 sample videos in a grid
3. Try the search bar (search for "Black Hole")
4. Try category filters (click "Astronomy")
5. Try difficulty filters (click "Beginner")
6. Click on any video card to go to watch page

### **5. Test Video Watch Page**
1. From browse page, click a video
2. OR directly visit: `http://localhost:3000/video/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
3. You should see:
   - Video player (or placeholder if no video URL)
   - Video title and description
   - Creator info
   - View count and date
   - Tags and categories
4. Note: Actual video playback requires AWS MediaConvert setup

---

## 📊 Database Integration

All pages connect to the GraphQL API which queries PostgreSQL:

**Login/Signup:**
- Uses `users` table
- Bcrypt password hashing
- JWT token generation

**Browse:**
- Queries `videos` table
- Joins with `users` table for creator info
- Supports filtering and pagination

**Video Watch:**
- Queries single video by ID
- Increments `views` count on play
- Fetches related data (tags, creator)

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

```
User enters credentials
  ↓
GraphQL mutation (login/signup)
  ↓
Backend validates & generates JWT token
  ↓
Token + User data stored in localStorage
  ↓
Apollo Client uses token for authenticated requests
  ↓
Navigation component reads localStorage
  ↓
Shows user menu if authenticated
```

---
