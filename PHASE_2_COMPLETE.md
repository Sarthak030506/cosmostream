## 🔧 GraphQL Integration

All pages use existing GraphQL queries/mutations:

- `thread(id)` - Get single thread with posts

**Mutations:**
- `updateProfile(name, bio, avatar)` - Update user profile

- `votePost(postId, value)` - Upvote/downvote post
- `changePassword` - Change user password (UI ready, backend pending)

## 🎨 Design Highlights

All pages feature consistent design:
- **Dark space theme** with cosmos/nebula gradients
- **Glass morphism** (backdrop blur, semi-transparent cards)
- **Smooth animations** on all interactions
- **Responsive grid layouts**
- **Loading skeletons** for better UX
- **Empty states** with friendly messages

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

2. **Settings** - Requires login
3. **Forums** - Can view without login, but must login to reply
4. **User menu** - Only shows when authenticated

---

## 📝 Code Quality

**TypeScript:**
- ✅ Proper types for all components
- ✅ GraphQL query types
- ✅ Form validation types

**React Best Practices:**
- ✅ Client components where needed
- ✅ Proper state management
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates

**Accessibility:**

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Features with UI Only (Backend Pending):

1. **Change Password** - Form exists, but mutation needs implementation
2. **Delete Account** - Button exists, functionality pending
3. **Follow Users** - UI ready, mutation pending
4. **Privacy Settings** - Toggles exist, persistence pending
5. **Notification Preferences** - Toggles exist, persistence pending
6. **Create New Thread** - Button exists, page `/forums/new` not built yet

### Data Limitations:

- Only 1 sample forum thread
- No video data on creator profiles
- Stats are mostly placeholder (0s)
- Activity feeds are empty

## 📈 Stats

## 🎯 Phase 2 vs Phase 1

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Total |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Pages | 4 | 5 | 9 |
| Features | 15 | 30+ | 45+ |
| Lines of Code | 800 | 1,400 | 2,200 |

## 🔜 What's Next (Phase 3)

Now that users can interact and build community, the next logical step is to add the **unique features** that differentiate CosmoStream:

**Phase 3 Options:**
1. **Sky Map** - Interactive 3D star visualization (Three.js)
2. **Live Missions** - Real-time space mission tracking
3. **Learning Paths** - Educational courses and quizzes
4. **Creator Dashboard** - Video upload and analytics

**My Recommendation:** Build the Sky Map next - it's the most impressive feature and will make CosmoStream stand out!

1. ✅ Manage their profiles

3. ✅ Customize settings
4. ✅ Browse forum discussions
